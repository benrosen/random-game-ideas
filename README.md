## How it works

First, a template is chosen randomly [from a list][1]. Then, [sentencer][3] is used to populate the template with random words. The result is displayed on the screen. That's it!

## Adding templates

Got an idea for a template? Great! Got ten ideas for templates? Even better! Add your idea(s) to [templates.js][1] and then [create a pull request][2]!
